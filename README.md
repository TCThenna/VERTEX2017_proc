# VERTEX2017_proc

These are the proceedings for the VERTEX 2017 proceedings.

##Targetted content:

Contrast and resolution studies for 2D X0 measurements in preparation for the 3D reconstruction.

Parameters to change:

 * Reconstruction method of the scattering width (RMS, RMS98, RMS98 with 0 as center, meanOfSquares, meanOfSquares98, GaussFit, Student's T fit, ..?)
 * Cell size (Plot contrast vs resolution)
 * Beam conditions? (Energy, energy spread, divergence, ...)
 * Optimal setup?
