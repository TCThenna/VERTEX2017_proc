# VERTEX2017_proc

These are the proceedings for the VERTEX 2017 proceedings.

##Targetted content:


Scope and order:

  * Focus on input for tomography: Contrast and resolution studies for 2D X0 measurements in preparation for the 3D reconstructiontracking (Triplet/GBL), estimator for width, bin size

  * find best (accuracy and robust) estimator for width (based on contrast)
  * GBL vs triplet in 2D (based on constrast)
  * reso vs contrast for various bin sizes

Parameters to change:

 * Reconstruction method of the scattering width (RMS, RMS98, RMS98 with 0 as center, meanOfSquares, meanOfSquares98, GaussFit, Student's T fit, ..?)
 * Cell size (Plot contrast vs resolution)
 * Beam conditions? (Energy, energy spread, divergence, ...)
 * Optimal setup?
